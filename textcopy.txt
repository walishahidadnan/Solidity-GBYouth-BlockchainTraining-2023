out the first task you need to calculate and verify the hash of a file named
“Lab5-6-2023.pdf” on LMS.
a. upload the file to an online hash calculator service and calculate its hash
using the SHA-256 hash function.
Write a program yourself which does the following:
b. accepts the online hash calculated in (1.a) as input and stores it
c. imports the above-mentioned file in your code and calculate the hash
(using SHA-256 hash function of hashlib python library)
d. compare both hashes from (b) and (c) and print out a message indicating
whether they match or not.
2. Create a text file containing random content of your own choice. Write a
program that calculates SHA-256 hash of this file. Demonstrate the
avalanche effect using this program, by making changes in the content.
3. Download the files named message1.bin and message2.bin from the
following links:
Message1.bin:
https://drive.google.com/file/d/14KwmJ-cD-bOrGz65Nh7jpJTEyoac3tpq/vie

Message2.bin:
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1U2K4cOks8Nb78kcJe6u4n8JP0HD2AhWk/v

a. Import these files.
b. Write a program that calculates the MD5 and SHA-1 hashes of the
downloaded files and prints out the results on the screen.
c. What results do you get? Describe your findings.
[Hint: Why wasn’t MD5 given a driving license?
